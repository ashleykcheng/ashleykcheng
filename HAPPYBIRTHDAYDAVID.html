						<h1>HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY DAVID OHHHHH</h1>
						<p>WOOOOOOO POG YOU'RE OLD NOW </p>
                        <h2>ITS PRETTY CRAZY THAT WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR SO LONG</h2>
                        <h3>LETS TAKE A LOOK AT SOME HIGHLIGHTS</h3>
                        <img src = "/static/special/david-stand.jpg" style = "width:300px; float: left; padding-right: 40px">
                        <h2>MIDDLE SCHOOL</h2>
                        <p>We both know I can't talk about middle school without bringing up asian neon boy but you were genuinely one of the nicest guys at South Lake. We weren't that close but Technology and Forehan-Kelly were always so much fun and the highlights of my day.</p>

                        <img src = "/static/special/david-slide.jpg" style = "width: 300px; float: right;padding-left: 40px">
                        <h2>9TH GRADE</h2>
                        <p>9th Grade was when we started talking more with Math and ITCP. You carried me in all those ITCP Projects but it was all so much fun. You always made class sm more bearable and entertaining. Formal was also so much fun.</p>
                        <img src = "/static/special/david-face.jpg" style = "width:300px; float: left; padding-right: 40px">
                        <h2>10TH GRADE</h2>
                        <p>I know when you saw your 10th grade schedule and saw that you had three classes with me you were just <b>SO EXCITED. </b>10th grade we started getting more close and I literally wouldn't have survived math, ap lang, or ap world without you saving me from the boredom of the class. Thank you for being such an amazing friend over the past few years. I could not imagine my life without you. I hope the next two years are just as memorable.</p>
                        <h2>It sucks that we can't see each other everyday in school like last year but I HOPE YOU HAVE AN <b>AMAZING</b> DAY AND 16TH YEAR OF LIFE.</h2>

                            Warrior Unified was created to bring together individuals with and without intellectual disabilities for
                            sports and fitness activities, and to promote social inclusion. Woodbridge High School students volunteer with special needs students and participate in sports together.
                            As President of this club, my job is to organize bi-weekly club meetings and facilitate club activities. I also make sure that other board members have the porper information necessary 
                            to do their jobs. I communicate frequently with the club advisor to schedule events and discuss ideas.  I am also responsible for holding board meetings and filling out any special paperwork.

                            The purpose of Girls Who Code is to inspire, educate, and equip girls with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities.
                            Our goal is to reach gender parity in computing fields. We believe this is paramount to ensure the economic prosperity of women, families,
                            and communities across the globe, and to equip citizens with the tools for innovation and social change. We believe that more girls exposed
                            to computer science at a young age will lead to more women working in the technology and engineering fields. As Vice President, I am responsible
                            for organizing weekly club meetings and setting up the club's curriculum. I keep in close contact with the club advisor and assist with future board applications.
                            I also run meetings in absence of the President.

                        I have been a starter on Woodbridge High School's Varsity Girl's Basketball team since I was a freshman. For the 2020-2021 school year I have been
                        chosen as one of two captains on the team. As co-captain I organize team events and provide leadership on and off the court. I constantly communicate between
                        the team and the coaches. I am also responsible for providing information from the coaches to the junior-varsity and frosh girl's basketball teams.

                       As coach of South Lake Middle School's Hoops Classic team, I organized multiple tryouts to select team members, led bi-weekly practices for

                        equipment needs of each high school sport.

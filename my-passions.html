                            From a very young age, I have always been very interested in programming. I am very lucky to have found an interest in computer science and artificial intelligence. I believe that these two fields will transform the future. I want to have an impact on future. By taking computer science courses in school and online, I have gained experience with the following programming languages:

                                    In order to learn these programming languages and facilitate my learning of computer science, I took several computer programming classes and
                                    taught myself with online resources.

                        As a freshman in high school from August 2018 to June 2019, I was enrolled in the course Introduction to Computer Programming. 
                        As part of this course taught at Woodbridge High School, I learned a variety of programming languages such as Visual Basic, HTML, and Java.
                        I also learned and applied elements of programming, robotics, algorithms for various tasks.

                       Introduction to Computer Systems, taught at Irvine Valley College, provides an overview of computer information systems and introduces hardware, software, networking, and Internet terminology.
                        The course introduces Windows and Microsoft Office software, focusing particularly on spreadsheet and database applications. It also introduces program development and programming languages.
                        Students write and execute elementary programs in Visual Basic. I completed this class during Summer 2020.

								<h3>Harvard University CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</h3>

							<p>
                                CS50 is an entry-level course taught by David J. Malan at Harvard University. CS50 is a self-paced class that includes recorded lectures from Harvard and the same problem sets Harvard students are assigned.
                                Languages taught include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
                                Students learn how to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently while exploring concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management,
                                security, software engineering, and web development. This website was created as the final project of this course.

                            CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, 
                            diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. 
                            Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, 
                            and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. I completed this self-paced course in September 2020.

                        In the beginning of 7th grade, I developed a strong passion for playing basketball. 
                        Since then, I have competed in tournaments throughout California.
                        As a scholar athlete, I
                        have learned how to manage 14 hours of practice per week with several AP and honors
                        classes. Basketball has also taught me valuable leadership and communication skills.

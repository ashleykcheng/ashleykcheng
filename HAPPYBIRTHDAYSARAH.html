                        <p>Middle School we weren't even that close but like it was so much fun hanging out with you and the rest of the squad. Halloween and the Promotion Dance were soooo much fun. Also can't forget standing outside of Forehan-Kelly for 20 minutes everyday after class.</p>

                        <img src = "/static/special/sarah-pencils.jpg" style = "width: 300px; float: right;padding-left: 40px">
                        <h2>9TH GRADE</h2>
                        <p>I know you were <b>SO HAPPY</b> to be in the same homeroom with me and OFC H English was SM FUN. I had so much fun hanging out with you with "eggs" and all that lmao. Thank you for being an amazing friend freshman year when things were scary and school was stressful.</p>

                        <p>10th Grade was SM FUN with all the dances and im SO MAD that our year got cut short. It was also a lot of fun doing DMA with you lol. Even though I like wasn't at lunch a lot of the times and we had like only one class together, I still always considered you one of  my closest friends. Thank you for always being there for me and being always so friendly.</p>
                        <h2>It sucks that we can't see each other everyday in school like last year but I HOPE YOU HAVE AN <b>AMAZING</b> DAY AND 16TH YEAR OF LIFE.</h2>

My name is Ashley Cheng. My github and edX usernames are ashleykcheng.

For my final project,  I created a digital portfolio outlining my accomplishments. The website includes 6 different webpages and is also interactive.
There are several buttons where you can download files, input your name, or go to a specific part of the webpage. I also carefully stylized my website
with CSS. I used flask to make my website interactive and to navigate around the website easier.
